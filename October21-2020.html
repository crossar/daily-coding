    <h1> <center> Phasmophobia </center></h1>
    <p> This is a game that I'm enjoying playing now with my family and friends. </p>
    <p> I play it on my laptop, this game cost like $13.99. It's worth it for my opinion hahaha! Hope you guys will give it a try. </p>
    <p> You can create a steam account if you're not familiar with it, and I recommend you guys watch Gameplay on Youtube so you will have an idea how it works.</p>
