            Ice Bear is one of the 3 main protagonists of We Bare Bears.

            Ice Bear is the youngest of the trio, but is, undoubtedly, the strongest and, in some respects, the most
            mature
            of them. He was able to rescue his older brothers from certain death without too much hassle and is quick to
            jump into action if he finds a threat arising. He cares for both of his brothers dearly. He tends to do most
            of
            the chores of the house, though he doesn't seem to mind this. Despite his willingness to pitch in where the
            others don't, he still takes days off to relax and unwind. Not only is he a smart and strong bear, but he's
            also
            essential to the Bears' brotherhood.

            "Grizzly Bear" is the overall main protagonist of We Bare Bears. Being a grizzly bear, he is familiar with
            the
            forest area the Bears live in. He is the leader of the three and is seen as such. He tries his best to do
            what's
            right for both the benefit of him and his family, but he can sometimes get carried away.

            Panpan seems to have more knowledge about things regarding technology and things from Asian culture. He is
            the
            middle brother and, as stated by Grizz, is "the link that holds them all together". He is Charlie’s best
            friend,
            but he doesn’t want to admit it. Although, he did admit it in "Panda's Art". He is to be the most delicate
            of
            the trio, being both quite anxious and, as Grizzly also described, "cute". Even so, he does care about his
            brothers and will try to pitch in whenever and however he can.

            In "Panda 2", it is revealed that he was originally raised in captivity in a Chinese Panda Zoo until he
            escaped
            and met Grizzly and Ice Bear on the way.
